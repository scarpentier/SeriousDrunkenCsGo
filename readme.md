#Serious Drunken Counter-Strike GO

This [Sourcemod](http://sourcemod.net) plugin will help you keep track of how many sips of beer to need drink while playing our **Serious Drunken CSGO** game.

## Game rules
You take a sip from your beer every time one of the following occurs:

| Event | Sips |
| :------ | ---: |
| Kill / Assist | 1 |
| Kill with headshot | 2 |
| Kill with knife | 5 |
| Win round | 1 |
| Be MVP | 1 |

As opposed to many drinking games, **drinking is a reward for kills**. Here, you drink when you DO kill (not when you GET killed). This also has the advantage to be more enjoyable for less experienced players because they will get kills once the more experienced players are inebriated.

Do **NOT** replace beer and take shots instead. This drinking game was engineered and carefully balanced with liquids ranging 4-7% alcohol / volume. Think about switching to water a few hours in depending on your tolerence.

*Please drink responsibly.*
